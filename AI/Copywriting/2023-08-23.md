Helck is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Nanaki Nanao. It was serialized in Shogakukan's Ura Sunday website and MangaONE app from May 2014 to December 2017, with its chapters collected into twelve tankōbon volumes. An anime television series adaptation by Satelight premiered in July 2023.

Plot
It has been three months since the Demon Lord was defeated by a lone human hero. While the humans celebrated their victory, the demon realm quickly organized a tournament to choose their next Lord. One peculiar contestant quickly rising up through the tournament is a human hero named Helck, who claims to hate his own kind. Vermilio the Red, one of the Four Elite Lords overseeing the tournament, immediately suspects Helck of being a saboteur and tries to rig the following matches into games of skill, but Helck continues to win. Vermilio soon finds out that Helck is a wanted criminal in the human realm, suspected of killing his brother, who happens to be the legendary hero Cless, the one who killed the Demon Lord. Vermilio still wants to know, what is Helck's true motivation for entering the tournament? What happened in the human realm over the past three months? And what are these mysterious winged soldiers now threatening the demon realm in place of the humans?

**About the Series**
Dive into the mesmerizing world of "Helck," an iconic manga masterpiece crafted by the talented Nanaki Nanao. After its much-acclaimed serialization on Shogakukan's Ura Sunday website and MangaONE app from May 2014 to December 2017, the tale is now being retold in a stunning anime adaptation. Produced by the renowned Satelight, the anime adaptation made its grand debut in July 2023.

**The Plot Unraveled**
The land is still echoing with the celebrations of the humans, basking in their recent victory against the Demon Lord - all thanks to a lone hero. But as they rejoice, the demon realm is plunged into a flurry of action, hosting a tournament to crown their next Lord.

Emerging from the shadows is an unexpected contender: a human hero, Helck. Not just any hero, but one who claims a profound distaste for his own kind. This sudden appearance sets the alarms ringing for Vermilio the Red, one of the Four Elite Lords. Suspecting Helck's motives, Vermilio tries to steer the competition, aiming to expose him. But Helck's victories are relentless.

The layers of mystery thicken when Vermilio discovers that Helck isn't just a hero, but a wanted criminal in the human world, accused of the unthinkable - the murder of his brother, the legendary hero Cless, the very hero responsible for the Demon Lord's downfall.

Questions loom large: What drives Helck to join the tournament? What transpired in the human realm during these three turbulent months? And as a new threat emerges, with mysterious winged soldiers menacing the demon realm, one wonders if the humans are truly done with their games.

**Watch as alliances are tested, truths are sought, and a new chapter of demon-human relations is written. Helck awaits!**
