## 三幕劇版
先讓英雄救貓咪的Blake Snyder's "Save the Cat!" Beat Sheet

* Act One: Setup
    1.	Opening Image: Show the state of the world with the peculiar creatures emerging and the gods withdrawing to their realm for safety. This sets the tone for a world in chaos and transition.
    2.	Theme Stated: The theme could be subtly hinted at during these early scenes – perhaps something about balance, the cost of power, or the nature of courage.
    3.	Set-Up: Introduce the protagonist, a human child, whose parents are researchers at the magic university. The chaos caused by the Berserker Kingdom and the malfunctioning barriers.
    4.	Catalyst: The protagonist loses contact with their parents amidst the chaos, leading them to flee, eventually ending up in the Elven Forest.
    5.	Debate: The protagonist, now somewhat older and feeling outcast in the Elven Forest, decides to leave for the Port City. This internal conflict sets the stage for their journey.
* Act Two: Confrontation
    1.	Break into Two: The protagonist's journey from the Elven Forest to the Port City signifies entering a new world - one filled with dangers and opportunities.
    2.	B Story: Introduce a subplot, perhaps involving a group or individual in the Port City that will aid in the protagonist's growth and mirror the main theme.
    3.	Fun and Games: The protagonist takes on a high-paying job to transport supplies but ends up on the front lines of battle, getting knocked out.
    4.	Midpoint: The protagonist is picked up by a dwarf warrior and reluctantly becomes part of the Berserker raids. This is a false victory as the protagonist is safe but at a moral cost.
    5.	Bad Guys Close In: Tension builds as the protagonist's mentor refuses to return to the village, despite a prophecy calling the Berserkers back.
* Act Three: Resolution
    1.	All Is Lost: The protagonist, now separated from the Berserkers, reaches the Empire. The Empire ignores the prophecy, adding to the sense of impending doom.
    2.	Break into Three: The appearance of special monsters from the west and the protagonist's decision to seek knowledge in the Necromancer area marks the final push against the threat.
    3.	Finale: As massive hordes of monsters emerge, the protagonist and allies attempt to use sealing spells. The temporary calm is shattered by the emergence of a black sun and the revival of the Demon God.
    4.	Final Image: The climactic battle with the Demon God. This final image should reflect the change from the opening image and resonate with the theme.
    Remember, while this structure provides a scaffold, it's important to weave character development, world-building, and thematic elements throughout these beats. The protagonist's journey should not just be physical but also emotional and philosophical, reflecting the broader themes of your narrative.

## 日系序破急版
* 序 (Jo) - Beginning:
    * This phase establishes the world and introduces characters and their initial situation.
    1.	World Setup: Present the world with the emergence of peculiar creatures and the gods' retreat to their realm. This sets a tone of mystery and impending change.
    2.	Introduce Protagonist: The human child of researchers at the magic university. Show their life before the chaos, providing a stark contrast to what is to come.
    3.	Initial Conflict: The malfunctioning barriers due to climate anomalies and the Berserker Kingdom's chaos leads to the protagonist's separation from their parents and subsequent arrival in the Elven Forest.
    4.	Establish Theme: Hint at themes of survival, identity, and courage as the protagonist navigates the Elven Forest, feeling like an outcast.
* 破 (Ha) - Break:
    * This is where the story develops and diverges, introducing complexities and challenges.
    1.	Journey to the Port City: The protagonist's decision to leave the Elven Forest marks a significant change in their journey, both physically and mentally.
    2.	New Challenges: The job to transport supplies that leads the protagonist into battlefront chaos. This can be where the protagonist's beliefs and skills are tested.
    3.	Middle Turn: The protagonist is rescued by the dwarf warrior and becomes part of the Berserker raids. Here, they face moral dilemmas and the harsh realities of the world.
    4.	Escalation: The tension rises as the protagonist grapples with the Berserkers' way of life and the looming threats signaled by prophecies and the Empire's indifference.
* 急 (Kyū) - Rapid:
    * The final phase where events rush to the climax and resolution.
    1.	Climax Build-Up: The protagonist's arrival at the Necromancer area and the Empire being pursued. Here, the stakes are the highest, and the protagonist's resolve is tested.
    2.	Final Confrontation: The emergence of the black sun and the Demon God's revival. This should be the most intense part of your story, with the protagonist and their allies facing their greatest challenge.
    3.	Resolution: The aftermath of the battle with the Demon God. Show how the world and the protagonist have changed due to these events.
    4.	Closing Image: Reflect on the journey and how the protagonist has evolved from the beginning. This could be a scene that shows a new balance or a new challenge hinting at future adventures.
    Remember, the 序-破-急 structure is flexible and focuses on the flow and rhythm of the story. It's essential to maintain a smooth transition from a slow, expository beginning (Jo), to an unfolding and divergence in the middle (Ha), and finally to a rapid, climactic end (Kyū). This structure is particularly effective in creating a dynamic and engaging narrative flow.
