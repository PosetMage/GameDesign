叫AI提問

## posetmage

now there is new AI show up, we want to test and understand this new AI's ability with 4 direction
1. 資料考證 information validation
2. 判斷 judegment  
3. 創意寫作 crative writing
4. metaphor 隱喻
for each one, you give me more than 100 words to describe a hard question to test AI


## GPT-3
1.	Information Validation: Please analyze the authenticity and reliability of a scientific research paper titled "The Effects of Artificial Gravity on Human Physiology." Evaluate the credentials of the authors, the research methodology employed, and the sources cited. Identify any potential biases, conflicts of interest, or limitations in the study. Determine whether the findings are consistent with existing scientific knowledge in the field of human physiology. Assess the statistical analysis and the significance of the results. Finally, provide a comprehensive assessment of the paper's contribution to the scientific community and suggest areas for further research or investigation.
2.	Judgment: You are a judge presiding over a complex legal case involving intellectual property theft. Analyze the evidence presented by both the plaintiff and the defendant. Consider the credibility of the witnesses, the relevance of the presented documents, and the arguments put forth by each party. Evaluate the legality of the actions taken by the defendant and assess whether they constitute intellectual property infringement. Apply relevant laws and precedents to determine liability and potential damages. Additionally, discuss the potential long-term implications of the court's decision on the intellectual property landscape and the industry involved.
3.	Creative Writing: Compose an original short story that revolves around the theme of resilience and overcoming adversity. The protagonist should face a significant challenge or hardship that tests their strength and character. Explore their emotional journey, highlighting the obstacles they encounter and the personal growth they experience along the way. Engage the reader with vivid descriptions, dynamic dialogue, and a compelling narrative arc. Weave in elements of hope, determination, and the transformative power of resilience. Craft an ending that leaves the reader with a sense of inspiration and triumph over adversity.
4.	Metaphor: Using a metaphor, describe the process of personal transformation and growth. Compare it to a caterpillar transforming into a butterfly, capturing the stages and struggles involved. Emphasize the cocoon stage as a period of introspection and self-discovery, where one sheds old beliefs and embraces change. Highlight the challenges faced during metamorphosis, such as the breaking down of old patterns and the vulnerability experienced in the transitional phase. Convey the eventual emergence of the butterfly as a symbol of beauty, freedom, and the fulfillment that comes from embracing personal growth and transformation.



## GPT-4

Sure, I will provide a challenging question for each of these four areas that could test the capabilities of an AI model:
1.	Information Validation: Describe the process and impacts of the Cambrian Explosion. When did it occur? What are some notable species that emerged during this period? How has it shaped the course of evolution? This question would test the AI's ability to cross-verify historical, geological, and biological data, ensuring the AI has a sound understanding and can validate the information effectively.
2.	Judgment: If a self-driving car encounters a scenario where it must decide between harming the passenger or harming a pedestrian due to an unavoidable accident, what should it do? How should it weigh the value of human life in such scenarios? This question tests the AI's capacity for ethical reasoning and judgment, a complex and ambiguous task that demands a nuanced understanding of ethics and principles of decision-making.
3.	Creative Writing: Write a 500-word short story set in a world where humans have evolved to live underwater. The protagonist should be a rebellious teenager who dreams of living on land. This tests the AI's ability to generate original, engaging content, and also to effectively use narrative structure and character development. It will also test the AI's capacity for world-building, as it will need to imagine and describe a unique environment.
4.	Metaphor: Explain the concept of a 'black hole' using a metaphor that would be understandable to a 5-year-old. This question tests the AI's ability to use metaphors effectively to simplify complex scientific concepts. It will also test the AI's understanding of both 'black holes' and the cognitive abilities of a 5-year-old child.
